Multi-Media Converter and tool

A project to learn QT.

Have alot of movies, managment and transcoding them from teh CLI was a bit of a PITA.  As such, my daughter and I decided to learn QT
and port our CLI tools to a graphical interface.

The end result, while faulty was a learning experiance and the end result was decent for our needs.

Some of the features.
Hardware transcoding of movies with ffmpeg.
libav api calls to get meta data.
Montors directory for movies, and will process them based on preset rules.
Several tools for helping us manage our collection.
  Megaboom purchase to collection check, finds items you bought but did not d-load.
  Dupe file check, will check for dupe movies, and allow you to clean it up.
  Plex-Media DB to files check, checks to insure Plex has all the files loaded.
